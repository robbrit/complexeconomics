# Description

Econerra is a simulation "game" for economics. The idea is to throw a whole
bunch of economic ideas into a simulation and see what happens.

# How to run

Make sure you have Go installed:

	go version

It should be at least version 1.15, since that's what Econerra has been built with.

To run it, just run the main file:

	go run cmd/main.go
